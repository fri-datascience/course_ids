This work is published under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 license (CC BY-NC-SA)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode). Creative Commons licenses are built of four building blocks, each corresponding to a different requirement:

* BY (attribution): this is a mandatory element of every CC license. Contrary to what is commonly believed, the attribution obligation in CC licenses extends beyond a simple indication of the name of the author; in fact, the user is obliged to retain a copyright notice (e.g. "(c) 2016 Paweł Kamocki"), a license notice (e.g. "This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License"), a disclaimer of warranties (if supplied) and a link to the licensed material.
* NC (non-commercial) means that no commercial use can be made. Commercial use is defined as use primarily intended for commercial advantage or monetary compensation. Please note that this category is extremely unclear and can discourage potential users. In our view, when it comes to licensing of research data, this requirement should be avoided.
* SA (share-alike): according to this requirement, if derivative works are made, they have to be licensed under the same or compatible license, i.e. a license containing the same (or compatible) requirements. There is only one license approved for compatibility with CC BY-SA 4.0 license: the Free Art License 1.3. In every other case, in order to comply with the SA requirement, you will have to re-license the derivative work under the same CC license, or its more recent version.
